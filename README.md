## Features

- **User Management**: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Inscriptions**: Users can list their inscriptions for sale.
- **Offers**: Users can make offers on listed inscriptions.
- **Chat System**: Users can chat with each other regarding offers and inscriptions.
- **Real-time Updates**: The application uses WebSocket for real-time communication.
- **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL ensures that all data is stored reliably.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several technologies to create a robust backend system:

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **Bitcoinjs-Lib**: A library for Bitcoin protocol-related functions.
- **Prisma**: An open-source database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- **WebSocket**: A protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- PostgreSQL (version 12 or later)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/belal20042/Ordinal-Marketplace.git
   cd Ordinal-Marketplace
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. An example `.env` file might look like this:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

4. **Migrate Database**:
   Run the following command to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

5. **Seed the Database (optional)**:
   If you want to populate your database with initial data, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the API endpoints. You can also use the frontend client to access the marketplace features.

### API Endpoints

Here are some key API endpoints you can use:

- **User Registration**: 
  - `POST /api/users/register`
  
- **User Login**: 
  - `POST /api/users/login`
  
- **List Inscriptions**: 
  - `POST /api/inscriptions`
  
- **Make Offer**: 
  - `POST /api/offers`
  
- **Chat Messages**: 
  - `GET /api/chat/:userId`

For detailed documentation on each endpoint, refer to the [API Documentation](#).
